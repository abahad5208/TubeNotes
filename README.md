# Tube Notes

## Description

This is a Chrome extension which uses IndexDB to allow the user to take notes on Youtube videos. You can create, edit, and delete notes. The notes taken will be arranged by the timestamp, and clicking on a note's timestamp will cause the video to skip to that point.

The main application of this extension, as I imagine it, if for people who watch tutorials and lectures on YouTube, and leave timestamps in the comments to mark what they consider important. With this extension, they can take these notes privately on their own systems. Similarly, people who watch long playthroughs or movies won't have to leave timestamps in the comments to remind themselves where they last left off, as they can simply take a note, and even mark their favorite parts.

The next main update is to try and add a way to save and load the notes in a .txt or .json file. This will allow users to share their notes with others, as well as take backups of their notes for specific videos. Future plans include making a Firefox version and cleaning up any bugs.
